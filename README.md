# CLIBX Command-Line Tool Documentation

**CLIBX** is a command-line tool created by Rudolf Müller, written  in **C++** that serves as a **package manager** for managing C/C++ libraries in your projects.  

Libraries can be installed directly from **Git repositories**, or you can use **kits** (sets of dependent libraries).  
The early prototype of CLIBX was written in **Python**.
